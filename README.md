# OopsGL
A delightful gallery of my glorious failures, cursed shaders, and WTF-worthy error messages encountered while doing graphics programming. Come for the pixels, stay for the panic.

# Game of life?
Mr Conway, I'm sorry. InitializeGrid() is called every frame, randomizing the entire grid constantly, so no cell gets to live long enough to make friends. Long story short: this simulation is less Game of Life, more Game of Eternal Amnesia on already massive grid.

# Retro-Plane-Heightmap
Initially wanted to make a retrowave graphics engine that would take a raster image and retrobeam it into a grid terrain. This was me fiddling about with it and I thought it looks sick.
